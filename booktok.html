            Emily Wilde's Encyclopedia of Faeries by Heather Fawcett
          </h2>

          <p>
            Cambridge professor Emily Wilde is good at many things: She is the
            foremost expert on the study of faeries. She is a genius scholar and
            a meticulous researcher who is writing the world's first
            encyclopaedia of faerie lore. But Emily Wilde is not good at people.
            She could never make small talk at a partyâ€”or even get invited to
            one. And she prefers the company of her books, her dog, Shadow, and
            the Fair Folk to other people.<br /><br />So when she arrives in the
            hardscrabble village of Hrafnsvik, Emily has no intention of
            befriending the gruff townsfolk. Nor does she care to spend time
            with another new arrival: her dashing and insufferably handsome
            academic rival Wendell Bambleby, who manages to charm the townsfolk,
            muddle Emily's research, and utterly confound and frustrate her.<br /><br />But
            as Emily gets closer and closer to uncovering the secrets of the
            Hidden Onesâ€”the most elusive of all faeriesâ€”lurking in the shadowy
            forest outside the town, she also finds herself on the trail of
            another mystery: Who is Wendell Bambleby, and what does he really
            want? To find the answer, she'll have to unlock the greatest mystery
            of allâ€”her own heart.<br /><br />

          <p>
            <em
              >Of course I want to be like them. They're beautiful as blades
              forged in some divine fire. They will live forever.<br /><br />
              And Cardan is even more beautiful than the rest. I hate him more
              than all the others. I hate him so much that sometimes when I look
              at him, I can hardly breathe.</em
            ><br /><br />
            Jude was seven years old when her parents were murdered and she and
            her two sisters were stolen away to live in the treacherous High
            Court of Faerie. Ten years later, Jude wants nothing more than to
            belong there, despite her mortality. But many of the fey despise
            humans. Especially Prince Cardan, the youngest and wickedest son of
            the High King.<br /><br />
            To win a place at the Court, she must defy him--and face the
            consequences.<br /><br />
            In doing so, she becomes embroiled in palace intrigues and
            deceptions, discovering her own capacity for bloodshed. But as civil
            war threatens to drown the Courts of Faerie in violence, Jude will
            need to risk her life in a dangerous alliance to save her sisters,
            and Faerie itself.<br /><br />

          <h2 class="mb-3">Iron Widow by Xiran Jay Zhao</h2>

          <p>
            The boys of Huaxia dream of pairing up with girls to pilot
            Chrysalises, giant transforming robots that can battle the mecha
            aliens that lurk beyond the Great Wall. It doesn't matter that the
            girls often die from the mental strain.<br /><br />
            When 18-year-old Zetian offers herself up as a concubine-pilot, it's
            to assassinate the ace male pilot responsible for her sister's
            death. But she gets her vengeance in a way nobody expectedâ€”she kills
            him through the psychic link between pilots and emerges from the
            cockpit unscathed. She is labeled an Iron Widow, a much-feared and
            much-silenced kind of female pilot who can sacrifice boys to power
            up Chrysalises instead.<br /><br />To tame her unnerving yet
            invaluable mental strength, she is paired up with Li Shimin, the
            strongest and most controversial male pilot in Huaxia.<br /><br />But
            now that Zetian has had a taste of power, she will not cower so
            easily. She will miss no opportunity to leverage their combined
            might and infamy to survive attempt after attempt on her life, until
            she can figure out exactly why the pilot system works in its
            misogynist wayâ€”and stop more girls from being sacrificed.<br /><br />
