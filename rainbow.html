          <p>
            Cambridge professor Emily Wilde is good at many things: She is the
            foremost expert on the study of faeries. She is a genius scholar and
            a meticulous researcher who is writing the world’s first
            encyclopaedia of faerie lore. But Emily Wilde is not good at people.
            She could never make small talk at a party—or even get invited to
            one. And she prefers the company of her books, her dog, Shadow, and
            the Fair Folk to other people.<br /><br />So when she arrives in the
            hardscrabble village of Hrafnsvik, Emily has no intention of
            befriending the gruff townsfolk. Nor does she care to spend time
            with another new arrival: her dashing and insufferably handsome
            academic rival Wendell Bambleby, who manages to charm the townsfolk,
            muddle Emily’s research, and utterly confound and frustrate her.<br /><br />But
            as Emily gets closer and closer to uncovering the secrets of the
            Hidden Ones—the most elusive of all faeries—lurking in the shadowy
            forest outside the town, she also finds herself on the trail of
            another mystery: Who is Wendell Bambleby, and what does he really
            want? To find the answer, she’ll have to unlock the greatest mystery
            of all—her own heart.<br /><br />
